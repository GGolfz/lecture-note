# Chapter 2 Operating System Overview

## Operating Systems

- A program that controls the execution of application program
- An interface between applications and hardware

### Main Objective
- convenience
- efficiency
- ability to evolve

### Operating System Services
- Program development
- Program execution
- Access I/O Devices
- Controlled access to file
- System access
- Error Detection and Response
- Accounting

### Key Interfaces
- Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
- Application Binary Interface (ABI)
- Application Programming Interface (API)

### The role of OS
- A computer is a set of resources for the movement, storage, and processing of data
- The OS is responsible for managing these resources

## Operating System as Software
- Functions in the same way as ordinary computer software
- Program, or suite of programs executed by the processor
- Frequently relinquishes control and must depend on the processor to allow it to regain control

## Evolution of OS
### Why ? 
- Hardware Upgrades
- New type of hardware
- New service
- Fixes
### State from past until now
- Serial Processing
- Simple Batch System
- Multiprogrammed Batch Systems
- Time Sharing Systems
