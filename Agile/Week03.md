# Project Management

If one process start, project start.
But for done, all processes must be finished

## Project divide to 5 phase

- Initial Process
- Planning Process
- Executing Process
- Monitoring and Controlling Process
- Closing Process

## Type of Organizational Structures

- 3 Types
- Functional -> เป็นลำดับชั้นการปกครองลงมา เช่น ประธาน รองประธาน หัวหน้าฝ่าย ต่าง ๆ

- Projectived -> Project Manager -> Divide to many team and each team can have different role.

- Matrix -> Combine Functional and Projectived which Proejctived will across the action level of Function (Action Level will join the team in the project) => Performance (One person can play more than one role.)

## Project Charter 

Document that authorizes a project (Project Contract ข้อตกลง)

## Purpose 
- Undertaking the project 
- Objective and constraints of project
- Direction concerning the solution
- Identities of the main stakeholders

## Project Definition

Have start date and end date => All project are temporary

Project Definition Document -> Describes the shape of project and objective and scope which should be clear and measurable.

Project Definition Document Components

- Introduction and Summary of the proejct
- Project Delivables
- Assumptions
- Resource Requirements
- Interrelated porjects
- Signatures
- Communation plan (meeting)
- Financial Analysis
- Project Objective
- Key Milestones
- Risk (In all project there are risk orientiate)
- Contrainst
- Acceptance Criteria
- Reviews
- Change management plan
- Reference

When we want to build project definition document, we should be answer this question.

## Basic Project Management Definitions

### Project
- Temporary
- Unique Project, service, result

### Subproject
- Set of work units assign to single project

### Project
- Group of related projects

### Project Management
- Application of knowledge skills tools technique to project activities to meet the project requirement

### Porfolio Management
- Centralized management of one or more portfolios, which includes identifying, prioritizing, authorizing, managing and controlling projects, program and other

### Project Management Office (PMO)

- Organizational body or entity assigned various responsibility related to centrallized and coordinated management under its domain

### Sponsor
- Individual / Organization that has the authorize to perform, delegate or ensure completion of the project commitments.

## Project Life Cycle Model

Start -> Concept Phase -> Develop Phase -> Execute Phase -> Finish Phase 

Concept Phase -> Thinking about the project, Gather data, identify need.

Develop Phase -> Develop project proposal and planning, detail project and solid objective, access risk.

Execute Phase -> Coding Part that activity is very high level

Finish Phase -> Finalize Products, review and accept, transfer product responsibility, and also evaluate project.

## Project Management Processes
- Project are composed of process
- Process -> Series of actions brigning about result
- Project management processes describe, organize, and complete the work of the project.
- Project-oriented processes address the specification and creation of the project product
- Project management processes and project-oriented processes overlap one another and interest throughout the life of the project

## PDCA (Plan Do Check Act)
Plan -> Establish the objective and process necessary to deliver results in accordance with customer requirement and organization policies.

Do -> Implement the process

Check -> Monitor and measure processes and product against policies, objective, and requirement and report the result

Act -> Take action to continually improve process performance

Step for PDCA

Plan
Step 1: Identify the problem
Step 2: Analyze the problem
Do
Step 3: Develop Solution
Step 4: Implement a Solution
Check
Step 5: Evaluate the result
Act
Step 6: Standardize the solution and capitalize on new opportunity

## Project = Small Business

Have problem and come with risk -> Need to identify customer expectation.

You implement for company -> Can control requirement but cannot control expectation

- Planning and Organizing the work

# Feasibility

## Introduction

"Whether or not to go ahead with a project"

Such evaluation is a part of feasibility studay (make sure that we should do/continue to project) based on 
- Existing Strategies
- Technical Criteria
- Economic Criteria
- Risk Involved

### Strategic Assessment
- กลยุทธ์ที่มีอยู่ ไม่ว่าจะเป็น Objective, Intofrmation Strategy.
### Porfolio Management

สำหรับพวก Softwarre House โปรเจคอะบางทีก็เพื่อเก็บเป็น port คือว่ามันส่งผลดีต่อดปรเจคอื่น ๆ ในอนาคตไหม เกี่ยวข้องกับ จุดประสงค์หลัก/ความเชี่ยวชาญของบริษัทเราไหม ถ้าทำแล้วจะมีประโยชน์ยังไงบ้าง นอกจากนี้ยังต้องดู ว่า Hardware and Software ที่เราอยู่เพียงพอต่อการทำไหมด้วย ถ้าไม่พอต้องวิเคราะห์ cost อีก


### Cost Benefit Analysis

วิเคราะห์ว่า cost ของเรามีอะไรบ้าง กับ benefit อะไรบ้างที่เราจะได้รับจากมัน

Direct benefit => Measure ได้
Assessable indirect benefits => ไม่ชัดเจน แต่ก็สามารถ Measure ได้ เช่นการเปลี่ยน UI แอป
Intangible benefit => วัดยากมาก ๆ

### Cash Flow Forecasting

- Indicate when and how much expenditure and income will take place.

### Net profit 

Different between the total cost and the total income over the life of project.

### Payback period 

The year that income can fit cost that we initial investment.

### Return on investment

Accounting Rate of Return (ARR)

ROI = AVG of Annual Profit / total investment x 100

AVG of Annual Profit = Net profile / year

Disadvantage => No account of timing of the cash flow and can misleading the decision with normal interest rates.

### Net Present Value

It can happen inflation that money current worth than future.

Present Value = Value in year t / (1+r)^t

### Internal Rate of Return

Provides a profitablity measure as a percentage return directly in comparable with interest rates.
