# Design Principle

Commonly understood as the rules, assumptions, or guiding statement that define the relationships between the elements of your design.

element => Everything on the screen

## Unity and Variety

### Unity

The degree to which elements in your design have an obvious association with each other.

You can demonstrate unity in many ways 
Ex: Color, Shape, Size, Style and the ways of position elements in the relationship to each other (proximity)

If everything is same it wouldn't make for a very visually interesting design.

### Veriety

In design element, you can make it clear and when there are differences between elements such as title and body and add to a sense of freshness or exploration (Can be difference size, difference color, location [line-space], thickness etc)

Challenging is figure out how to achieve unity in visual experience (Which will help users understand) but still represents some of different that user needs or targeting.

Another challenge is representing elements in your design that vary from each other in character but can work together for a particular purpose. (Such as Delete is red, Save is Green but same type of button (size, width, border-radius))

For example, you may want to associate text-based information with button-based action that you'd like users to take once they've read that information

In this case, you may take visually different elements and associate them with proximity, grouping or chunking information together so they appear related. If elements are disassociate by too much space, It will hard to understand.

## Hierarchy and Dominance

### Hierarchy

The established order of the elements being viewed.

Thing in higher hierarcher more prominent and more likely to stand out to the viewer

Thing in lowewer hierarchy tend to be supportive and may seem less important.


Hierarchy influences the path that a user's eye will take when scanning a page.

Some of the factors that determine a user's understanding of hierarchy are location, colour, and size of the action object (like a button), tone and length of any text.

### Dominance

Generally, objects that are larger, brighter, and have higher contrast against other objects on the page have more dominance, and text that is short and commanding will attract attention as well.

Limit number of dominant items on the page in order to have a clearer hierarchy of elements, and to make your primary actions stand out.

Image also tend to attract attention.

Faces can be visually arresting, and dramatic photos will dominate the page.

Subtle or not so sbubtle - animation can draw the eye.

The location of elements also influences the user's understanding of hierarchy. (Z Style)

Cultural difference

Before starting to design a specific page or view, it's helpful to list and designate the weight of all of the eleements on the page, giving each a status of primary, secondary, or tertiary.

This practice will help you make choices about location, size and color to reinforce the hierarchy on the page.

In defining these relationships, you'll becreating a visual language for the site or application - a consistent treatment of elements and their place in the hierarchy, which will subtly help users understand thier meaning and behavior.

## Economy of Elements

A very busy design with many elements may seem like a lot of voices shouting to the user. (May cause user confusing which one is important and when it need)

When design has a good economy of elements -> When element is purposeful, relevant, and information-rich. 

When those that aren't removed -> able to ensure the information can be easily digested and acted upon.

Three levels of information, help reinforce meaning
- Shape (Circle vs Triangle)
- Symbol (Checkmark vs Exclamation point)
- Color 

## Proportion and balance

A design's proportion refers to the size relationships of its elements to each other, and to the outer dimensions of the overall design

## Associations and Affordance

Folder -> Metaphor for interaction

Association with objects in the physical world gives you a clear understanding of how they should work in the digital space.

Using associations can be very strong, but be careful - it's also very easy to start breaking the rules and stretching your visual metaphor to the point of breaking.

When designing objects that need to be acted on, most of the time, follow one of these rules:

- Use an association with something of common use in the physical world that provides clues on how it is used digitally.
- Follow the common standards of interactive elements online, such as showing links in an obviously different colour from the regular text.

- Consider the likely perceived affordance of the design element.

An object's affordance: the degree to which the properties of the object make it clear how it can be used.

Physical things: their shapes provide affordance to how they should be used.

Digital objects: don't have the physical properties, but their look, fell, and behavior can build perceived affordance that help communicate their ability to be acted on.

## Economy of Motion

The user has gone from understanding that an action can be taken to taking it.

How quickly and effectively she can do that depends on the distance she has to travel to get to the object, and the ease with which she can act on it.

On a web page, for example, a small button far from her cursor is going of take longer to use than a large one right next to it.

Fitts' Law:
The time required to rapidly move to a target area is a function for the distance to the target and the size of the target.

So why is it that most navigation is far away from where the user is likely to be - at the top and bottom edges of screen ?

Partly it make sure it's out of the way of changing content in the middle, but also because the navigation is pinned to the edge, users are less likely to overshoot when moving to it with a cursor or pointing with finger. So the position actually makes it a larger target.

Thinking of distance and target size may seem obvious, but it demonstrates an understanding of an economy of motion that you should be considering when designing navigational elements, and that can be easy to forget when you're in the middle of design.

When placing elements consider this:

### How far is it from where the user probably is?
Good from design, for example this into account - if a user is moving through a series of fields on the far left side of the screen, button on the far right will take longer to click than buttons directly below the last field. If this is a highly used form, this could be annoying and inefficient

### Are you requiring users to switch methods of input - Ex: keyboard to mouse?
Switches like this are inefficient, so consider the way users may interact with a page or a task using both input methods. Keyboard-centric users will appreciate the ability to hit the enter key, for example rather than having to go from entering form into with their keyboard and moving the mouse to find and click submit button

### How easy is it to act on the object?
A larger target is easier to hover over and to click on - simple larger button is an exmaple of that. Nested menus, where users have to hover to open other options and keep the menu open while they select one, can be difficult to use for some users, especially if the menu is unforgiving and disappears if the user accidentally moves the cursor off when trying to select and option.

Nested menus are effective when dealing with a large number of categories, but they are more difficult to act on than a simple button or link - especially for users that have difficulties with vision or fine motor control.

In addition to the economy of motion within a page, consider the number of clicks required for a user to complete a particular task.

For something used every day for critical work, a large number of clicks will become inefficient and frustrating for users.

Having all options closely gathered and present can be overwhelming.

It's not rare to hear business stakeholder say, "I don't want anything to be more than three clicks away," as if clicks are the only economy that matters.

In design you need to balance discoverability and access (which is provided if all options are up and close together) with simplicity and economy of elements.
