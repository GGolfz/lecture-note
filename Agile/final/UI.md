# User Interface

## Designing for people

User Interface => what a user see/hear. (What user receive from the system) 

We want user interface to usable, easy to use, user friendly => usability

User Experience => Larger than UI => What a user face (Everything that affect to feeling of user) How they feel, What they think ?

Focus on the feeling, opinion,impression

We can design User interface (UI) but we cannot designed user experience (UX) because we can build UI as same as the design. For the user experience we cannot control the feeling, expectation of user. But we can control the factor that has the influence to earn a good user experience (Increase the chance to make people happy).

---

For Mobile App we focus on the visual so it is what user see.

Good interface start from understand people.

- What they're like
- Why they use a given piece of software
- How they might interact with it

Interface ที่ดีนั้นเริ่มมาจากการเข้าใจผู้ใช้ อาจจะตั้งคำถามว่า เขาชอบอะไร ทำไมเขาถึงใช้ และเขาจะใช้งานมันอย่างไร

### Structure of Understanding design for people

1) Context: Who is your audience ?

2) Goals: What are they trying to achieve ?

3) Research: Way to understand context and goals

4) Patternes: Cognition and behavior that related to interface design

## Context

### Understand the human context for your design intention

You need to define and understand the people who will use your design, understand that what they want to do and how they interact with your software. Understand their expectation, knowledge of relevant subject, information domains, and skill levels.

### Know your audience

You need to know the behavior of your audience because the software that supports human behaviors better helps users achieve their goals.

### Interactions are conversations

There are two participants in the conversation: the person and the software.

There is a exchange of information between two participants.

The exchange is a series of requests, commands, reception, processing, and response.

The human needs continuous feedback from the interface that confirms that things are working normally, inputs are being processed, they are proceeding satisfactorily toward the goal of the moment.

For the software, it should be understandable to its partner, it should indicate it's active, and it should be obvious when it's responding.

Script of a conversation

- Motives and intention
- Vocabulary of words, icon, and gesture
- Expectation

### Match your content and functionality to your audience

The subject-specific vocabulary you use in your interface should match your users' level of knowledge.

If some users won't know the vocabulary, give them a way to learn the unfamiliar terms.

If they don't know computers very well, don't make them use sophisticated widget or uncommon interface-design convention.

If their level of interest might be low, don't ask for too much effort for too little reward.

For example, how mcuh openness is there in the interface? How much freedom your users have to act arbitrarily?

Software installation: have only next, previous, cancel because it need to focus and specific but it can works and make user satisfy.

Excel: have huge number of feature because it allow user to do anything that user satisfy.

### Skill level

Intermediate to expert
- Complex functionality
- Don't need the walkthrough step by step
- Assume that users already know what to do
- Optimise for efficient operation, not learnability
- Entire books and course; learning curves are steep

Occasional users (นาน ๆ ใช้ที)
- Used to use but not use for a long long time.
- Restrained in functionality but helpful about explaining along the way
- Provide a simplified interface: like a search box
- Provide help to increase learnability

In the middle
- Need to serve people on both ends adequately
- Help user to learn the tool
- Enable frequent-user intermediates to get things done smoothly
- Find balance that works for your situation

Context: Understand user in various way to get the idea of design interface

--- 
## Goal

Interface is just a means to the ends.
- What the users are really try to accomplish
- Filling out a form is almost never a goal in itself, the real goal is buying something online, renew membership, or install software
- When user or client tells you that they want a certain feature, ask them why they want it?

Design Value: Solve the right problem (what they want to do?) then solve it right (user get good ux).

---
## Research

Ways to understand people, context, and goals

Empirical discovery

- Qualitative research

For understanding your audience's expectations, vocabulary, and how they think about their goals or structure their work and also detect pattern.

- Quanititative research

To start a design, you need to characterize the kinds of people who will use the software.
- Go out and meet them
- Each user group is unique
- Target of audience is difference (Ex: New mobile phone app & scientific software)
- Even it is same people but expectation are different
(Scientific: High functionality, Mobile App: Difficult UI)

You should figure out  what generally true about your users.

What to learn from research ?
- Their goal in using the software or site
- The specific tasks they undertake in persuit of those goals
- The language and words they use to describe what they're doing
- Their skill at using software similar to your software
- Their attitude toward to software that you gonna build, how difference design affect to their attitude?

### Research Method

### Direct Observation
- Interview, onsite user visits => Put you directly into user world
- On location
- Structured or Unstructured
- A lot of flexibility
- Many or few, long or short, formal or informal, phone or inperson

### Case studies
- Deep details views into a few representative users or groups of users

### Survey
- Collect information from many users.
- No direct human contact -> Miss a lot of extra information
- Whatever you don't ask about, you won't learn about
- Careful survey design is also essential 
- Question should be correct
- Survey receiptant should be correct and suitable
- Analyse answer correctly

### Persona
- Help you to figure out what to do with your data after you finish collect it.
- Model the target audience, simulate their behavior: fictional peson, who capture the important aspects of a group of users
- Tasks that they're trying to accomplist
- Ultimate Goals
- Experience level

You should plan to research carefully => Who and how many.

## Pattern
- Cognition & Behavior ralated to Interface Design
- Pattern is common way of people think => related to software interfaces
- Although people are different but it can predictably
- Interface that supports pattern well help user to achieve their goals more than interface that not supports pattern

### Safe Exploration
> "Let me explore without getting lost or getting into trouble."
Good software must allow people to try something unfamiliar, backout, and try something else, all without stress.
- Visibility of system status
- Match between the system and real world
- User control and freedom

### Instant Gratification
> "I want to accomplish something now, not later."
- People like to see immediate results from the action they take.
- If someone starts using an application and gets a "success experience" within the first few seconds, that's gratifying.
- They will be more likely to keep using it, even if it becomes more difficult later.
- If you can predict the first thing that a new user likely to do, you should design the UI to make that first thing stunningly easy.
- Anticipate their need, provide an obvious entry point, provide value to customer first before asking for something valuable (Email, Sale) in return

### Satisficing
> "This is good enough. I don't want to spend more time learning to do it better."
- Satisficing: combination of satisfying and sufficing
- People are willing to accept 'good enough' instead of 'best' if learning all the alternatives might cost time and effort.
- Give directions on what to do first: type here, drag an image here, tap here to begin, etc.
- Make labels short, plainly worded, and quick to read (menu items, buttons, links, and anything else identified by text)
- Write them so that user first guess about the meaning is correct
- Use the layout of interface to communicate meaning, Users parse the color and form on sight, they follow these cues more efficiently than labels that must be read.

### Changes in Midstream
> "I change my mind about what I was doing."
- People might change what they are doing while in the middle of doing it.
- You can make it easy for someone to start a process, stop in the middle, and comeback to it later to pick up where they left off - property often called reentrance.
- Provide back to same place (Ex: go from page 6 and when click back should in page 6)

### Deferred Choices
> "I don't want to answer that now, just let me finish"
- If you ask a task-focused user unneccessary questions in the process, they might prefer to skip the questions and come back to them later.
- Create new video project in video editor, there something need to fill in the front such as name but something like where to save when done might be easily to defer.

### Incremental Construction
> "Let me change this. That doesn't look right; let me change it again. That's better."
- When people create things, they start with small piece of it, work on it, step back and look at it, test it, fix what's wrong, and start to build others parts of it.
- The creative process moves backward as much as forward sometimes.
- Builder-Style interface need to support that style of works.
- Make it easy for users to build small pieces, keep the interface responsive to quick changes and saves. Feedback is critical: constantly show the user what the entire thing looks like.

### Habituation
> "That gesture works everywhere else; why doesn't it work here too?"
- When you user an interface repeatedly, some frequent physical actions become reflexive. (Ex: click back button to leave webpage)
- The user no longer needs to think consciously about these action. They've become habitual.
- These tendency help people become expert users of a tool.
- Habituation also measurably improve efficiency
- But it can also lay traps for the user. If a gesture becomes a habit and tries to use it in situation that it doesn't work, user may caught short.
- Consistency across applications can be an advantage to use in your software design.
- Just as important is consistency within an application.
- Because of habituation, confirmation dialog boxes often doesn't work to protect a user against accidential changes.

### Microbreaks
> "I'm waiting for the train. Let me do something useful for two minutes"
- People often find themselves with a few minutes of downtime. They want to do something constructive or entertaining to pass the time, knowning they won't have enough time to get deep into an online activity 
- This pattern is especially applicable to mobile device
- The key to supporting microbreaks is to make an activity easy and fast to reach
	- Don't require complicated setup.
	- Don't take forever to loud
	- If the user needs to sign in, try to retain the previous authentication.
- For Stream and Feed service, load the freshest content as quickly as possible and show it in the first screen the user sees.
- Game, video, or online books should remember where the user left them last time and restore the app or site to its previous state without asking (reentrance)
- Long load times to load content is a sure way to make users give up on your app.

### Spatial Memory
> "I swear that button was here a minute ago. Where did it go?"
- When people manipulate objects and documents, they often find them again later by remembering where they are, not what they've named. (จะจดจำตำแหน่งมากกว่าชื่อ)
- People tend to use spatial memory to find things on the desktop, and it's effective
- People devise their own groupings, for instance, or recall that "this document was at the upper right over by such-and-such"
- Many app put dialog button (OK,Cancel) in predictable place (เดาได้) because spatial memory for them is so strong.
- In complex app, people might find thing by remember where they relative to others (Ex: tools on toolbars)
- Add item to blank space in interface doesn't cause problem, but rearranging existing might disrupt spatial memory and make it difficult to find.
- Along with habituation, spatial memory is another reason why consistency in application is good. People might expect to find similar functionallity in similar place 
- Spatial memory explains why it is good to provide user-arranged areas for storing documents and objects. When people arrange things themsevles, they're likely to remember where they put them.
- This is why changing menus dynamically can sometimes backfire. Try to keep menu items in the same place and in the same order on all subpages in a site.
- The top and bottom of lists and menus are special locations. People notice and remember them more than items in the middle of the list.

### Prospective Memory
> "I'm putting this here to remind myself to deal with it later."
- We engage in prospective memory when we plan to do something in the future, and we arrange some way of reminding ourselves to do it.
- Memory aids that people use can include the following:
	- notes to oneself, like virtual "sticky notes"
	- Windows left on-screen
	- annotations put directly into documents
	- browser bookmarks, for website to be viewed later
	- documents stored on the desktop rather than in the usual places in the file system.
- Don't try to design a system that's too smart for its own good. (Don't assume that just because window been left idle for a while and no one use it so it should be closed)
- Many applications recall the last few objects or documents they edited

### Streamlined Repetition
> "I have to repeat this how many times?"
- In many kinds of applications, users sometimes find themselves needing to perform the same operation over and over again.
- The easier for them, the better
- Find and Replace dialog box, Macros
- Direct observation of users can help you to determine just what kinds of repetitive tasks you need to support.

### Keyboard only
> "Please don't make me use the mouse"
- Some people prefer not to keep switching between the mouse and keyboard because that takes time and effort.
- Keyboard-only usage is particularly important for data-entry application. Speed of data entry is critial, and users can't afford to move their hands off the keyboard to the mouse every time they want to move from one field to another.

### Social Media, Social Proof, and Collaboration
> "What did everyone else say about this?"
- People are social.
- We tend to be influenced by what our peers say and do. We are powerfully attuned to seeking approval from others and belonging to a group.
- We are much more likely to watch, read, buy, join share, comment, or take any other action if we see that someone we know thas recommended it or done it. This is called **social proof**
- Some examples of social functionality:
	- User-generated reviews and comments
		- These allow individuals to get a sense of the wisdom of the crowd
		- Reviews can be rated and participants can gain fame or ther rewards for being rated as a good reviewer
- Everything is a social object
	- Text posts, images, video, almost anything that users create in social media becomes an object that people can virtually gater around.
	- Anytihng can be shared, rated, have a discussion thread attached to it, and similar activities.
- Collaboration
- Social Proof motivates people to take action. 
- Social group identity, participation, and recognition are powerfully rewarding to people.
- Designing these capabilities into your interface creates the opportunity for social dynamics to increase your audiences' engagement, reward, and growth
