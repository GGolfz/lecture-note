# User Interface

## Designing for people

User Interface => what a user see/hear. (What user receive from the system) 

We want user interface to usable, easy to use, user friendly => usability

User Experience => Larger than UI => What a user face (Everything that affect to feeling of user) How they feel, What they think ?

Focus on the feeling, opinion,impression

We can design User interface (UI) but we cannot designed user experience (UX) because we can build UI as same as the design. For the user experience we cannot control the feeling, expectation of user. But we can control the factor that has the influence to earn a good user experience (Increase the chance to make people happy).

For Mobile App we focus on the visual so it is what user see.

Good interface start from understand people.

- What they're like
- Why they use a given piece of software
- How they might interact with it

Interface ที่ดีนั้นเริ่มมาจากการเข้าใจผู้ใช้ อาจจะตั้งคำถามว่า เขาชอบอะไร ทำไมเขาถึงใช้ และเขาจะใช้งานมันอย่างไร

### Structure of Understanding design for people

1) Context: Who is your audience ?

2) Goals: What are they trying to achieve ?

3) Research: Way to understand context and goals

4) Patternes: Cognition and behavior that related to interface design

## Context

### Understand the human context for your design intention

You need to define and understand the people who will use your design, understand that what they want to do and how they interact with your software. Understand their expectation, knowledge of relevant subject, information domains, and skill levels.

### Know your audience

You need to know the behavior of your audience because the software that supports human behaviors better helps users achieve their goals.

### Interactions are conversations

There are two participants in the conversation: the person and the software.

There is a exchange of information between two participants.

The exchange is a series of requests, commands, reception, processing, and response.

The human needs continuous feedback from the interface that confirms that things are working normally, inputs are being processed, they are proceeding satisfactorily toward the goal of the moment.

For the software, it should be understandable to its partner, it should indicate it's active, and it should be obvious when it's responding.

Script of a conversation

- Motives and intention
- Vocabulary of words, icon, and gesture
- Expectation

### Match your content and functionality to your audience

The subject-specific vocabulary you use in your interface should match your users' level of knowledge.

If some users won't know the vocabulary, give them a way to learn the unfamiliar terms.

If they don't know computers very well, don't make them use sophisticated widget or uncommon interface-design convention.

If their level of interest might be low, don't ask for too much effort for too little reward.

For example, how mcuh openness is there in the interface? How much freedom your users have to act arbitrarily?

Software installation: have only next, previous, cancel because it need to focus and specific but it can works and make user satisfy.

Excel: have huge number of feature because it allow user to do anything that user satisfy.

### Skill level

Intermediate to expert
- Complex functionality
- Don't need the walkthrough step by step
- Assume that users already know what to do
- Optimise for efficient operation, not learnability
- Entire books and course; learning curves are steep

Occasional users (นาน ๆ ใช้ที)
- Used to use but not use for a long long time.
- Restrained in functionality but helpful about explaining along the way
- Provide a simplified interface: like a search box

In the middle
- Need to serve people on both ends adequately
- Help user to learn the tool
- Enable frequent-user intermediates to get things done smoothly
- Find balance that works for your situation

--- 
## Goal

Interface is just a means to the ends.
- What the users are really try to accomplish
- Filling out a form is almost never a goal in itself, the real goal is buying something online, renew membership, or install software
- When user or client tells you that they want a certain feature, ask them why they want it?

Design Value: Solve the right problem then solve it right.

## Research

Ways to understand people, context, and goals

Empirical discovery

- Qualitative research

For understanding your audience's expectations, vocabulary, and how they think about their goals or structure their work and also detect pattern.

- Quanititative research

To start a design, you need to characterize the kinds of people who will use the software.
- Go out and meet them
- Each user group is unique
- Target of audience is difference (Ex: New mobile phone app & scientific software)
- Even it is same people but expectation are different
(Scientific: High functionality, Mobile App: Difficult UI)

You should figure out  what generally true about your users.

What to learn from research ?
- Their goal in using the software or site
- The specific tasks they undertake in persuit of those goals
- The language and words they use to describe what they're doing
- Their skill at using software similar to your software
- Their attitude toward to software that you gonna build, how difference design affect to their attitude?

### Research Method

### Direct Observation
- Interview, onsite user visits => Put you directly into user world
- On location
- Structured or Unstructured
- A lot of flexibility
- Many or few, long or short, formal or informal, phone or inperson

### Case studies
- Deep details views into a few representative users or groups of users

### Survey
- Collect information from many users.
- No direct human contact -> Miss a lot of extra information
- Whatever you don't ask about, you won't learn about
- Careful survey design is also essential 
- Question should be correct
- Survey receiptant should be correct and suitable
- Analyse answer correctly

### Persona
- Help you to figure out what to do with your data after you finish collect it.
- Model the target audience, simulate their behavior: fictional peson, who capture the important aspects of a group of users
- Tasks that they're trying to accomplist
- Ultimate Goals
- Experience level

You should plan to research carefully => Who and how many.
