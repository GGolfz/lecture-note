# Usability Guideline

## 1) Visibility of System Stutus

Knowing what the current system status is can help users learn the outcome of their prior interactions and determine next steps.

Predictible interactions create trust in the product as well as the brand.

### Tips

- Communicate clearly to users what the system's state is - no action with consequences to users should be taken without informing them.
- Present feedback to the user as quickly as possible
- Build trust through open and continuous communication

### Examples

### "You are Here" Maps
Interaactive mall maps have to show people where they currently are, to help them understand where to go next.

### Checkout flow
Multistep processes show users which steps they've completed, they're currently working on, and what comes next.

### Phone tap
Touchscreen UIs need to reassure users that their taps have an effect - often through visual change or haptic feedback.

User should know what going on of the system
Such as the download it should show the loading bar or snackbar to tell user instaed of showing nothing. User should know that their action is success or not.

Clicking on Download Button
- Unsuccessful
- Can't Download
- Downloading

If not display anything user may click again that is unwanted experience and user will not satisfy


## 2) Match between System and the Real World

The design should speak the users' language. Use words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than internal jargon, Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.

### Tips
- Ensure users can understand meaning without having to go look up a word's definition.
- Never assume your understanding words or concept will match those of your users.
- User research will help you uncover your users' familiar terminology, as well as their mental models around important concepts.

### Example
### Stovetap controls
When stovetap controls match the layout of heating elements, user can quickly understand which control maps to each heating element.

### "Car" vs "Automobile"
If users think about this object as a "car" use that as the label instead.
(No need to use hard word)

### Shopping cart icon
A shopping cart icon is easily recognizable because that feature serves the same purpose as its real-life counterpart.


## 3) User Control and Freedom

Users often perform actions by mistake. They need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted action without having to go through an extended process.

When it's easy for people to back out of a process or undo an action, it fosters a sense of freedom and confidence.

Exits allow users to remain in control of the system and avoid getting stuck and feeling frustrated.

### Tips
- Support undo and redo.
- Show a clear way to exit the current interaction.
- Make sure the exit is clearly labeled and discoverable.

### Example
### Exit Sign
Digital spaces need quick "emergency" exits, just like physical spaces do.
### Undo and redo
These functions give users freedom because they don't have worry about their actions - everything is easily reversible.
### Cancel button
Users shouldn't have to commit to a process once it's started - they should be able to easily cancel and abandon.

## 4) Consistency and Standards

Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform and industry conveentions.

Jakob's law states that people spend most of their time on products other than yours. Failing to maintain consistency may increase the users' cognitive load by forcing them to learn something new.

### Tips
- Improve learnability by maintaining both types of consistency: internal and external
- Maintain consistency within a signle product or a family of products (internal consistency).
- Follow established industry conventions. (external consistency)

Internal consistency: Between pages in website.

External consistency: All product of organization.

### Example
### Check-In counter
Check in counters are usually located at the front of hotels. This consistency meets customers' expectations.

### Design System
Using elements from the same design system across the product lines lowers the learning curve of users.

### Notification
A standardized notification design provides a similar but distinguishable look and feel for different app pop-ups.

## 5) Error Prevention

Good error messages are important, but the best designs carefully prevent problems from occuring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions, or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.

There are two types of erros: slip and mistakes

Slips are unconscious erros caused by inattention.

Mistakes are conscious errors based on a mismatch between the user's mental model and the design.

### Tips
- Prioritize your effort: Prevent high-cost errors first, then littlefrustrations.
- Avoid slips by providing helpful constraints and good defaults.
- Prevent mistakes by removing memory burdens, supporting undo, and warning your users.

### Example
### Guard rails
Guard rails on curvy mountain roads prevent drivers from falling off of cliffs.

### Airline confirmation
The confirmation page before checking out on airline websites gives users another chance to review the flight details.

### Date Selection on calendar
Offer good defaults and set boundaries when people book services by dates. Grey out unavailable options.
## 6) Recognition Rather than Recall

Minimize ther use's memory load by making elements, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the interface to another. Information required to use the design should be visible or easily retrivable when needed.

Humans have limited short-term memories. Interfaces that promote recognition reduce the amount of cognitive effort required from users.

### Tips
- Let people recognize information in the interface, rather than having to remember ("recall") it.
- Offer help in-context, instead of giving users a long tutorial to memorize.
- Reduce the information that users have to remember.

### Example
### Lisbon
People are more likely to correctly answer the question "Is Lisbon the capital of Portugal?" rather than "What's the capital of Prortugal?"

### Comparison table 
Comparison tables list key difference so that users don't need to remember them to make comparisons.

### Search
Search queries are presented together with the results as a reference.

## 7) Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
Shortcuts - hidden from novice users - may speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the design can cater to both inexperienced and experienced user. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.

Flexible processes can be carried out in different ways, so that people can pick whichever method works for them.

### Tips
- Provider accelerators like keyboard shortcuts and touch gestures.
- Provide personalization by tailoring content and functionality for individual users.
- Allow for customization so users can make selections about how they want the product to work.

### Exmaple
### Shortcuts
Regular routes are listed on maps but locals with more knowledge of the area can take shortcut

### Keyboard shortcut
Keyboard shortcuts for complex products can help expert users finish their tasks more effiently.

### Tap to like
Social apps allow two ways to like posts, Experienced users can tap to like because it speeds up thier browsing.

## 8) Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

Interfaces should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in an interface competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visiblity.

This doesn't mean you have to use a flat deisgn - it's about making sure you're keeping the content and visual design focused on the essentials. ensure that the visual elements of the UI support the user's primary goals.

### Tips
- Keep the content and visual design of UI focus on the essentials.
- Don't let unnecessary elements distract users from the information they really need.
- Prioritize the content and features to support primary goals.

### Exmaple
### Ornate vs simple teapot
Excessive decorative elements can interface with usability.

### Communicate, don't decorate
Over-decoration can cause distraction and make it harder for people to get the core information they need.

### Messy vs Organized UI
Messy UI increases the interaction cost for users to find their desired content; Organized UI lowers the cost.

## 9) Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors

Error Messages should be expressed in plain language (no error codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.

Error messages should be presented with visual treatments that will help users notice and recognize them.

### Tips
- Use traditional erro message visuals, like bold, red text.
- Tell users what went wrong in language they will understand - avoid technical jargon.
- Offer users a solution, like a shortcut that user can solve the error immediately.

### Example
### Wrong Way sign

Wrong-way signs on the road remind drivers that they are headling in the wrong direction and ask them to stop.

### Internest connection error
Good internet connection error pages show what happened and constructively instruct users on how to fix the problem.

### No search results
Provide useful help when people encounter search-result pages returning zero results, such as popular topics.

## 10) Help and Documentation

It's best if the design doesn't need any additional explanation. However, it may be necessary to provide documentation to help users understand how to complete their tasks.

Help and documentation content should be easy to search and focused on the user's task. Keep it concise, and list concrete steps that need to be carried out.

### Tips
- Ensure that the help documentation is easy to search.
- Whenever possible present the documentation in-context right at the moment that ther user requires it.
- List concrete steps to be carried out.

### Example
### Airport information center
Information kiosks at airports are easily recognizable and solve customers' problems in context and immediately.

### Frequently asked questions
Good frequently-asked-question pages anticipate and provide the helpful information that users might need.

### Information icon
Information icons reveal tooltips to explain jargon when users touch or hover over them, which provides contextual help.
